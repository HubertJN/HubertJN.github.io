This page represents a web version of my comprehensive CV. I aim to keep it reasonably up-to-date. Where information is available elsewhere on this site, I have linked to that content rather than duplicate it here.

## Research experience
* **September 2022 – Present**: PhD Researcher, Department of Physics, University of Warwick, UK 
  * Supervisor: [Prof. David Quigley](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/staff/academic/quigley/) (University of Warwick)  
  * Project Title: "<i>Rare-event kinetics, enhanced Monte Carlo sampling, and ML-assisted modelling</i>"  
  * Summary: Researching rare-event kinetics and enhanced Monte Carlo sampling with applications to phase transitions and thermodynamics in high-entropy alloys. Developing ML committor/collective-variable models to improve reaction-rate estimation and nucleation pathway characterisation. Designing and optimising HPC workflows for large-scale simulation and ML training (parallel CPU/GPU execution and Slurm-based automation). Outputs include peer-reviewed publications (e.g., JOSS; <i>Journal of Physics: Materials</i>) and preprints on flat-histogram parallelisation and alloy modelling.

* **October 2021 – July 2022**: Final-Year Project Student, University of Warwick, UK
  * Supervisor: [Dr. John Marshall](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/staff/academic/marshall/) (University of Warwick)  
  * Project Title: "<i>Classification of neutrino-induced particles, and characterisation of showers at the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE)</i>"  
  * **Summary**: Analysed simulated DUNE detector events in Python to classify neutrino-induced particle signatures and characterise shower topology. Evaluated classifier performance using ROC analysis and boosted decision trees to quantify separability across event classes.

* **Summer 2021**: Research Intern, Department of Mathematics, University of Warwick, UK  
  * Supervisor: [Dr. Radu Cimpeanu](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/cimpeanu/) (University of Warwick)  
  * Project Title: "<i>Deformation of Droplets at High Speeds</i>"  
  * Summary: Simulated high-speed droplet deformation using Navier–Stokes solvers with [Basilisk](http://basilisk.fr/). Collaborated with a computational fluid dynamics group to review numerical methods, validate results, and iterate on the modelling approach.

* **Summer 2020**: Research Intern, School of Engineering, University of Warwick, UK  
  * Supervisor: [Dr. Peter Brommer](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/eng/people/staff/brommer/) (University of Warwick)  
  * Project Title: "<i>Monte Carlo Study of the Equilibrium State of NiAl Crystal</i>"  
  * Summary: Developed a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler in Python and interfaced with [LAMMPS](https://docs.lammps.org/) as the atomistic simulation engine. Analysed trajectories to investigate equilibrium behaviour and identify transition bands in the sampled state space.

* **Summer 2019**: Research Intern, Deparment of Physics, University of Warwick, UK
  * Supervisor: [Dr. John Duffy](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/staff/academic/duffy/) (University of Warwick)
  * Project Title: "<i>Phase Transitions and Dielectric Properties of Nano-confined Water</i>"
  * Summary: Operated a liquid-nitrogen-cooled cryostat and vacuum system for temperature-controlled dielectric measurements. Implemented PID temperature stepping in LabVIEW and measured dielectric properties of porous media saturated with water.

## Industry experience
* **July 2025 - Present**: Data Labeler, Alignerr, Remote
  * Contributed to multiple concurrent labelling/evaluation projects with tight deadlines; adapted rapidly as priorities and guidelines changed.
  * Selected for pilot tasks and edge-case work; refined guidelines by documenting ambiguities and proposing clearer decision rules.
  * Created training data for MCP usage (tool/agent workflows), including careful annotation and basic quality checks.
  * Wrote short reports on recurring failure modes and workflow bottlenecks; feedback used to improve throughput.
