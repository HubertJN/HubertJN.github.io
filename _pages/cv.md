## Software
For information on software, please see the [software page](/software/) of this site.

## Research experience
* **University of Warwick** — PhD Researcher (Supervisor: Prof. David Quigley), Sep 2022 – Present (Coventry, UK)  
  * Research on rare-event kinetics and enhanced Monte Carlo sampling; applications to phase transitions and thermodynamics in high-entropy alloys.
  * Developing ML committor/collective-variable models to improve reaction-rate estimation and nucleation pathway characterization.
  * Designing and optimizing HPC workflows for large-scale simulation and ML training, including parallel CPU/GPU execution and Slurm-based automation.
  * Outputs include peer-reviewed publications (JOSS; *Journal of Physics: Materials*) and preprints on flat-histogram parallelization and alloy modeling.

* **DUNE Event Classification & Shower Characterisation** — Master’s Project Researcher (Supervisor: Dr. John Marshall), Oct 2021 – Jul 2022 (Warwick, UK)  
  * Analysed simulated DUNE detector events in Python to classify neutrino-induced particle signatures and characterize shower topology.
  * Applied ROC analysis and boosted decision trees to evaluate classifier performance and quantify separability across event classes.

* **Deformation of Droplets at High Speeds** — Research Intern (Supervisor: Dr. Radu Cimpeanu), Summer 2021 (Warwick, UK)  
  * Simulated high-speed droplet deformation using Navier–Stokes solvers with Basilisk (<http://basilisk.fr/>).
  * Collaborated with a CFD group to review numerical methods, validate results, and iterate on modelling approach.

* **NiAl Equilibrium via Monte Carlo** — Research Intern (Supervisor: Dr. Peter Brommer), Summer 2020 (Warwick, UK)  
  * Developed a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler in Python and interfaced with LAMMPS (<https://docs.lammps.org/>) as the atomistic simulation engine.
  * Analysed trajectories to investigate equilibrium behaviour and identify transition bands in sampled state space.

* **Nano-confined Water Phase Transitions** — Research Intern (Supervisor: Dr. John Duffy), Summer 2019 (Warwick, UK)  
  * Operated a liquid-nitrogen-cooled cryostat and vacuum system for temperature-controlled dielectric measurements. 
  * Implemented PID temperature stepping in LabVIEW and measured dielectric properties of porous media saturated with water.

## Industry experience
* **Alignerr** — ML Evaluation (project-based team), Jul 2025 – Present (Remote)  
  * Contributed to multiple concurrent labelling/evaluation projects with tight deadlines; adapted rapidly as priorities and guidelines changed.
  * Selected for pilot tasks and edge-case work; refined guidelines by documenting ambiguities and proposing clearer decision rules.
  * Created training data for MCP usage (tool/agent workflows), including careful annotation and basic quality checks.
  * Wrote short reports on recurring failure modes and workflow bottlenecks; feedback used to improve throughput.

## Skills
* **Languages:** Python, C, Fortran, Bash, LaTeX, LabVIEW  
* **HPC & Parallelism:** OpenMP, MPI, CUDA C, CUDA Python  
* **Developer tools:** git/GitHub, Linux, GCC, NVCC, Make, Slurm  
* **Libraries & ML:** NumPy, SciPy, PyTorch, scikit-learn, HDF5  
* **Data & visualization:** data handling, normalization, visualization  
* **GPU training:** CUDA C/C++ Fundamentals (2023); Multi-GPU CUDA C++ (2024); CUDA Python Fundamentals (2024)
