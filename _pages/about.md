I am a theoretical physicist and computational materials scientist, currently a final-year PhD student in the Department of Physics as part of the Centre for Doctoral Training in Modelling of Heterogeneous Systems at the University of Warwick, UK. Prior to beginning my PhD, I completed my undergraduate degree in physics at the University of Warwick.

My current research has two avenues:

1. **Wang–Landau sampling and alloy thermodynamics**  
   I develop scalable and parallelisable variants of the Wang–Landau algorithm for calculating densities of states in alloy systems. This includes analysing the efficiency of different parallelisation strategies, improving load balancing across energy windows, and applying flat-histogram sampling to high-entropy alloy thermodynamics.

2. **Machine learning for statistical physics**  
   I apply supervised machine-learning methods to characterise transition dynamics in many-body systems, with a focus on learning the committor function in the 2D Ising model. This work examines how neural networks capture physically meaningful structures and how they can be interpreted to provide insight into rare-event behaviour.

My broader interests include algorithms for statistical mechanics, high-performance scientific computing, and interpretable machine learning for physical systems.
