<h3>Abstract</h3>
We investigate the thermodynamics and phase stability of the AlTiVCr lightweight high-entropy alloy using a combination of ab initio electronic structure calculations, a concentration wave analysis, and atomistic Monte Carlo simulations. In alignment both with experimental data and with results obtained using other computational approaches, we predict a B2 (CsCl) chemical ordering emerging in this alloy at comparatively high temperatures, which is driven by Al and Ti moving to separate sublattices, while V and Cr express weaker site preferences. The impact of this B2 chemical ordering on the electronic transport properties of the alloy is investigated within a Kubo-Greenwood linear response framework and it is found that, counter-intuitively, the alloy's residual resistivity increases as the material transitions from the A2 (disordered bcc) phase to our predicted B2 (partially) ordered structure. This is understood to result primarily from a reduction in the density of electronic states at the Fermi level induced by the chemical ordering. At low temperatures, our atomistic Monte Carlo simulations then reveal subsequent sublattice orderings, with the ground-state configuration predicted to be a fully-ordered, single-phase structure with vanishing associated residual resistivity. These results give fresh, insight into the atomic-scale structure and consequent physical properties of this well-studied, technologically relevant material.
