<h2>Abstract</h2>
Flat histogram methods such as Wang-Landau sampling [1] provide an efficient route for high-throughput calculation of phase diagrams in atomistic and lattice-model systems. Numerous parallelisation schemes have been proposed to improve sampling performance across distributed architectures [2-4]. In this study, these schemes are systematically benchmarked-both in isolation and in combination-to establish best practice for scalable flat-histogram simulations [5]. The schemes examined include energy-domain decomposition with both static sub-domains and a dynamic sub-domain sizing approach which we propose. We also assess the benefit of replica exchange and multiple random walkers per sub-domain to determine which factors most strongly influence parallel efficiency and load balance. The influence of sub-domain overlap is likewise discussed. As an illustrative test case, we implement [6] and apply [7] these strategies to a lattice-based model describing the internal energies of the AlTiCrMo refractory high-entropy superalloy, which is known to crystallographically order into a B2 (CsCl) structure with decreasing temperature. Our results demonstrate the superlinear speedup available from energy domain decomposition, and that implementation of non-uniform energy windows has a greater benefit than adding additional random walkers per window.
